# U.S.-Air-Quality-Analysis-and-Data-Warehouse-Project-2021-2023-
This project focuses on analyzing trends and patterns in air quality across the United States from 2021 to 2023. It involves building a comprehensive Data Warehouse, implementing ETL processes, designing an OLAP model, conducting data analysis, and generating insightful visual reports.

📂 Data Sources
Daily air quality data from the EPA for U.S. counties (2021–2023).
Enriched with geographic information and AQI classification definitions for deeper insights.

🏗️ Data Warehouse Design
Develop dimensional tables, including:

🌍 Geography: State > County

📅 Time: Year > Quarter > Month > Day
Additional dimensions tailored for reporting requirements.

📊 Reporting and Analysis Objectives
AQI Trends: Visualize AQI fluctuations over time.
Air Quality Insights:
Identify days with high pollution levels.
Examine factors influencing air quality.
Regional Mapping: Use geographic visualization to show average AQI by region.

💡 Data Mining and Prediction
Implement data mining models to forecast future air quality (e.g., Q1-2024).
Explain selected algorithms, their rationale, and outcomes.

📈 Project Goals
Data Modeling: Design a star or snowflake schema for efficient analysis.
ETL Implementation: Utilize SSIS to collect, clean, and integrate data.
OLAP and Visualization: Leverage SSAS and create visual reports using SSRS or Excel.
Predictive Analytics: Apply data mining techniques with SSAS for forecasting.

📜 Outcomes
This project delivers a comprehensive overview of U.S. air quality trends in 2023, identifies key factors, and proposes actionable recommendations for improving air quality in the future.
